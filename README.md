# uikit-concept

In this UIKit concept demo, I've created the main ViewController with UIKit and the detail view with SwiftUI. iOS min version is 13.0.

ProductsViewController is built programmatically.
InfoViewController is just a small Objective-C view, but it's not connected due to build issues while adding the bridging header.
This project has unit tests but not 100% code coverage. Especially in the view, which I didn't have enough time to test in viewDidAppear with the Task.


### Possible improvements:
- Add a button in ProductsViewController to show InfoViewController.
- Extend InfoViewController (Objective-C) functionality.
- Improve test code coverage.
- Improve the UI.
- Improve the currency conversion algorithm.
